## About
This project is re-creating battleship with vanilla JS. This assignment is a hands-on project that is a lesson in test-driven development (TDD).

## Features
- Players take turn guessing which coordinates the opponent's ship is located
- Players can add up to 7 ships of lengths 1-5 throughout their board and the opponent will use the same ship configurations on their board
- Once a player's ships are all sunk, the game is over
